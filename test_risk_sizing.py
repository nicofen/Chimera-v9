"""
chimera/server/publisher.py
StatePublisher — the bridge between SharedState and the WebSocket layer.

Runs as an asyncio task inside the mainframe process.
Every POLL_INTERVAL seconds it:
  1. Serializes the current SharedState into a snapshot dict.
  2. Diffs it against the previous snapshot.
  3. If anything changed, puts the diff onto a broadcast queue.
  4. The WebSocket handler drains that queue and sends to all clients.

This decouples the publishing rate from the agent cycle rates —
agents can update state at any frequency; the dashboard always gets
a clean 250 ms cadence with no duplicate sends.
